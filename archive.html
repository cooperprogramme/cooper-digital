                            The Mi'kmawey Debert Cultural Centre is a native canadian historical site and archive in Nova Scotia. During my time working with them, they were in the process of a vast transformation and construction of a new cultural center.
                            <br><br>
                            I collaborated with the organisation as the sole designer over 12 months to provide the MDCC with a new digital direction. Their archive holds more than 20,000 records aimed to protect and educate the public on the culture of the Mi'kmaw through language, location, objects, history and practices.

                            The new construction of the physical center in correlation to the digital space meant that our collaboration on their portal had periods of intermediate pauses - requiring a strategy of ongoing workshops and user-testing to ensure continuity and progression. 
                            <br><br>
                            Crafting the information architecture, wireframe prototyping and digital branding, I lead remote workshops and presentations with their senior board members from a variety of departments to help establish a consistent vision.

                            The Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum, part of the Washington University in St.Louis, is home to the education and research of the university's growing collection, featuring a selection of contemporary art from world renowned artists such as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Jackson Pollock, Theo van Doesburg and Josef Albers.
                            <br><br>
                            The museum had ambitious goals to enhance their web presence and online services, streamlining their public request systems for visiting and reproductions, as well as expanding on their scholarly research and educational resources. Aiming to not only engage with public audiences but also to become an educational hub for university students.

                            I lead the design of their new digital platform, iterating with key stakeholders from each department.

                            Their branding consisted of the font Akkurat and a few printed leaflets. I referenced this material to build out a consistent digital brand system, with a refined colour palette and minimalist grid systems for layout and interaction components, helping to create a subtle visual expression that allowed the artwork and editorials to become the central focus.

                            Located in Port Sunlight, the historic home of Unilever in the UK, the Unilever Art, Archives and Records Management team look after one of the most important collections of business records in the world. The team are responsible for the collection and management of Unilever’s archives which span several centuries – the oldest of which is a document that dates as far back as 1292. The collections contain original documents, printed sources, images and films, an example being the first advert that was ever aired on television for S. R Gibbs toothpaste. 
                            <br><br>
                            The archive also contains minute books reporting on company board meetings, financial records, a wealth of advertising and examples of packaging, as well as architectural plans and maps of current and former Unilever sites. Well-known brands, such as Colman’s, Wall’s, Lipton, Persil, Pears Soap, Lux, PG Tips and Marmite, all feature in the collections.

                            Key solutions included creating an intuitive hierarchical structure for folders and sub-folders in over 100 seperate collections, forms for accessing a specific selection of records to view onsite or requesting to reproduce commercially and privately, and the ability to create user-accounts to save records to custom folders, save search criteria and encouraging the audiences to contribute through sharing personal memories and images online.

                            Tagger is a crowd-sourcing initiative in which users of Art UK are invited to tag artworks with descriptive words that help to make the artworks in the collection more searchable by subject matter whilst algorithms ensure the accuracy of the tags. As a result users of Art UK are able to search for themes and topics relevant to their interests.

                            Audiences will recall the old version of Tagger on the BBC 'Your Paintings' website which was retired before the launch of Art UK in 2016. Taggers purpose is to provide their audience with an incredibly satisfying and fun way of making a valuable contribution to improving Art UK whilst seeing some great art on the way, a similar concept to a CAPTCHA system.

                            Tagger aims to transform the searchability of artworks on Art UK, most of which still only have small numbers of tags, whilst many have none. The previous tagger version launched 10 years ago saw over 10,000 tags added by the public, all competing to be top of the leaderboard.
                            <br><br>
                            My role was to lead the design and oversee the production of the new Tagger interface. This included the complete user-experience and interface, collaborating with Art UK's core senior team. Producing dynamic diagrams for users to see contributions, a leaderbpard for (opted-in) users to participate and a simple, intuitive interface for adding tags, challenging existing tags and confirming pending tags.

                            Qute is the mobile companion of Qi for Movement Control of collection objects and adding content. Qi is the web-based, SPECTRUM compliant, Universal Content and Collections Management System for Museums, Archives, Libraries, Performing Art and other cultural organisations.

                            Qute enables archivists to scan a barcode or enter an accession number, in order to lookup essential object information and find the current location of any object in their collection. They can then enter a new location from the location authority (queried in real time) directly on their iPhone or iPad and save a draft movement to Qi, for later review and approval once back at your desk.

                            Between 1964 and 1969 the Paul Mellon Foundation began to collate an internationally important collection of reference photographs of paintings, sculpture, architecture, and the decorative arts, as well as images of sketchbooks and exhibitions. At this point in history, “British art” arguably lacked a serious body of scholarship, especially in comparison to the art histories of its neighbours on the Continent, and dedicated research resources were scant. 
                            <br><br>
                            A photographic archive was established to address this gap, providing access to art that was often locked behind the closed doors of Britain’s private country houses and collections. This practice was continued when the Foundation was re-established as the Paul Mellon Centre (PMC) in 1970, and maintained until 2013, at which point the collection contained more than 100,000 reference images.

                            The possibility to compare and contrast images of works taken at various points in their lifetimes, and to amalgamate the differing descriptive metadata records, is something that will affirm the relevance and vibrancy of these collections.

                            I worked with PMC to provide the complete UI for the digtial archive, based on the standard wireframe functionality provided by TMS software templates. A collection of approximately 100,000 reference photographs of British paintings, decorative painting, sculpture, drawings and prints covering the period 1500-1900 with some files into the twentieth Century. It has a particular emphasis on the eighteenth century.

                            I joined Kt in August 2015, being scouted by the managing director at the end-of-year graduation exhibition for my BA (Hons) degree course in graphic design, which showcased a selection of my work. Interestingly, none of which were focused on digital design - my portfolio consisted of print, publication and typeface design.

                            My role naturally grew and required more senior involvement since joining the studio, but a consistent responsibility throughout was to be the studio's manager of all brand communications.

                            During the beginning of the pandemic, commercial projects were put on hold by clients, and new commissions were non-existent. I decided to utilise this time to learn frontend development (HTML, CSS and [a bit of] JS).

                            The design incorporated and presented the entire digitised family archive. I created a visual identity with contemporary, readable and friendly typography, combined with a subtle colour pallete and border-radius rounded edges, giving a 'photo album' appearance.

                            To ensure users felt ownership of the archive, they were given the ability to create their own albums using archival content, upload new content as well as add comments on records, allowing for families of different generations to connect and share histories lost within the catalogue.

                            On March 6, 1836, 189 Texians and Tejanos gave their lives at the Alamo for Texas liberty. In 2011, the Texas Legislature tasked the Texas General Land Office with management and preservation of the Alamo and today, it remains under the custodianship of Commissioner George P. Bush.
                            <br><br>
                            The effort to preserve and restore the Alamo began in 2015 and has undergone intense debate and discussion. In January of 2019, Alamo Plaza was finally reunified with the Alamo Church and Long Barrack, and efforts began to reclaim the historic 1836 Battlefield. The story of the Alamo is world renowned and represents the core of Texas’ identity today. The ongoing effort to restore dignity and reverence to this sacred historic site through the comprehensive Alamo Plan is underway.

                            The Alamo approached us to provide a new content management system and website. The project was split between two deliverables: migration, integration and ongiong software servies to hold their digitised collections; and to provide a new online presence for the presentation of their archival materials. 
                            <br><br>
                            My role was to lead the new digital publication of their archive. Emphasising on narrative and curation (but with a limited budget), we played the contraints to our advantage and presented the collection as a series of stories to express that the collection's rich history is more than just the 'Battle at the Alamo'. With a variety of unqiue layouts and visual identity, the project aimed to push the 'traditional' archive into unknown territories. Scope included complete UX, direction, pitching and production.

                            The Sainsbury Archive documents the history of Sainsbury’s from its foundation in Drury Lane in 1869, but also provides a unique record of the transformation that has occurred in retailing since the mid-19th century, and the impact of these changes on society.

                            The core of the archive was formed at the time of the company’s centenary in 1969 and has steadily grown to more than 700 linear metres of shelving, including documents, objects (ranging from food preparation and testing equipment, to product packaging and staff uniforms), photographs and audiovisual material. The collection includes a large number of photographs and artefacts, and is particularly strong in the areas of product packaging, advertising and retail stores.

                            Collaborating with a creative director and UX designer, I provided art direction options and produced half of the user experience design of the product. Attending meetings with key stakeholders and iterating the design through each stage. Features include enabling the public to share personal memories attached to archival records, create and curate their own albums, a family tree and timeline sections and hierarchal archive tree structure.

                            The gallery was undergoing a rebrand and as part of this, employed us to produce their new digital identity. A condition of pivotal importance was to transition the brand as an 'evolution' rather than a 'revolution'.

                            The interactive exhibition space uses digital technologies to challenge standard narratives and provide 360-degree views on global, regional and local stories. The museum aspires to represent the diversity of voices, perspectives, events and people that contributes to the evolving media world that surrounds and affects us all.

                            The Ashmolean's collection of art and archaeology spans more than ten thousand years, and contains over a million artefacts documented in paper records covering more than 330 years. The Digital Collections programme was established in 2015 with the aim of creating cross-searchable digital records.

                            Having met an initial target to make 25% of the Ashmolean's objects available online by 2020, the Museum continues to digitise the collection and prepare records for publication online. Major projects in progress include the digitisation of the Egyptian collection, the numismatic collection, and portrait prints from the Hope collection.

                            The original collection was designed by studio Keepthinking long before I joined the company.

Delivered within an intense timeline, the design was completed and signed-off within 5 days, and development started shortly after.

To suggest the institution’s role in enabling such ambitions, they selected the name “Dia,” taken from the Greek word meaning “through.”

                            (Work in Progress) PT 1200 is a typeface system designed for the studio standard font for my non-commercial, experimental design practice (coming soon). The typeface is a culmination of my love and research of mid-century modernist design values. A Neo-Grotesk font inspired by systematic principles (such as the font Univers, created by Adrian Frutiger in 1957). 
                            <br><br>
                            PT 1200 is based on a custom 12 column grid of square units, each width, weight and italic style is precisely aligned to the grid system. This rational approach allows for a multitude of variations while maintaining solid consistency across each class.

                            Upon completion, the font will have 5 widths, each containing 6 weights and italics, allowing for a total of 60 styles. Including diacritics, punctuation and symbols, it supports over 100 latin based languages.
                            <br><br>
                            Over the course of 6 years, each individual character was carefully drawn using vector paths, later developed into different font formats and refined kerning and metrics using the Glyphs application.
